# Data Sets

This repository contains sample data sets used in the courses I teach. Each folder contains a separate data set.

## Clickstream

This data set consists of 3 days of IIS web logs from a sample e-commerce website (nopCommerce). The data set contains activity of anonymous users browsing products on the website. With the exception of spiders and robots, the he original IP addresses were replaced with other valid IP's. Included in the data set is an IP to location CSV (comma separated values) file.
